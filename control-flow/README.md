# Python Control Flow Projects

This repository contains several Python scripts demonstrating the use of control flow statements, loops, and functions. Each task showcases fundamental concepts in Python programming.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Weather Recommendation Program
- **File**: `weather_advice.py`
- **Description**: Asks the user about the weather (sunny, rainy, cold) and recommends appropriate clothing using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

### 2. Simple Calculator with Match Case
- **File**: `match_case_calculator.py`
- **Description**: A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division using Pythonâ€™s `match` statement. Includes handling division by zero.

### 3. Multiplication Table Generator
- **File**: `multiplication_table.py`
- **Description**: Prompts the user for a number and prints its multiplication table (1 to 10) using a `for` loop.

### 4. Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops
- **File**: `pattern_drawing.py`
- **Description**: Asks for a size input and prints a square pattern of asterisks (`*`) using nested loops.

### 5. Personal Daily Reminder
- **File**: `daily_reminder.py`
- **Description**: Prompts the user for a task, its priority, and if it's time-bound. Provides a custom reminder using `match` and conditional statements.
